I completed my masters studies in Physics in 2021 from University College London (UCL). I was a part of the Rosta Research Group in the UCL Condensed Matter & Materials Physics (CMMP) group where I was supervised by Dr. Edina Rosta. My research interests lie in dynamical clustering techniques of Markovian kinetic systems. 

Before studying at UCL, I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics & Physics at Wesleyan University in the United States. 

A copy of my most recent CV can be found [here](CV.pdf).
