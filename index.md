### Hello 

Welcome to my website! I'm using this space to share some of my projects that I think are fun and interesting. I have always been interested in mathematics and physics, so I have some projects relating to these areas. More recently, I have started to take more interest in mathematical applications to finance so there are a couple projects with some simple trading strategies that I decided to explore. 

I hope you enjoy the site and find the projects interesting too!
